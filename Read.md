Language Detection and Translation Application

This Python program creates a Multilanguage Translator with support for text translation, text-to-speech (TTS), speech-to-text (STT), and automatic language detection. The application uses the googletrans, gtts, and speech_recognition libraries for language translation, speech synthesis, and speech recognition, respectively.

Features

Text Translation: Translate text from one language to another.
Speech-to-Text: Convert spoken language to text.
Text-to-Speech: Convert text to spoken language.
Auto Language Detection: Automatically detect the language of the input text.
Language Swapping: Swap the source and target languages for translation.
Filtering Language Selection: Filter language options dynamically in combo boxes.
Voice Interaction: Input and output voice translation features.
Clear and Stop: Clear text areas and stop voice listening at any time.

Libraries Required

googletrans: For translating text between languages.
gtts: For converting text to speech.
speech_recognition: For converting speech to text.
pygame: For playing the audio generated by gTTS.
tkinter: For the graphical user interface (GUI).

Installation
You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
pip install gtts
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pygame


Usage

Language Selection:

Choose the language of the input text or speech in the first dropdown (can be auto-detected).
Choose the target language for translation in the second dropdown.

Text Translation:

Enter text into the first text area and click the "Translate" button to translate it into the selected target language.

Speech-to-Text:

Click "Listen Input" to speak and convert your speech to text. The text will appear in the first text area.

Text-to-Speech:

Select a language and click "Listen Output" to hear the translation or input text read aloud.

Voice Translation:

Click "Translate Voice" to speak the text, and the program will automatically recognize the language, translate, and output the result.

Clear Text Areas:

Click the "Clear" button to reset the text areas.

Stop Listening:

Click the "Stop" button to stop the listening process for voice recognition.

Language Swap:

Click the "Swap" button to swap the source and target languages.

How It Works

Key Components:

GUI Interface (Tkinter): The main window is created using Tkinter, with several buttons, combo boxes, and text areas to allow interaction.

Language Detection (LangID): The program detects the language of the entered text using the langid library.

Voice Interaction (Speech Recognition & gTTS): The program uses speech_recognition to convert speech to text and gtts for text-to-speech functionality.

Translation (Google Translate API): The program translates between languages using the googletrans API.


Important Functions:

detect_language(): Detects the language of the input text.

auto_deduct(): Automatically detects the language of the entered text and updates the language selection.

translate_text(): Translates the entered text into the selected target language.

listen_input(): Converts the spoken input into text.

listen_output(): Converts the output text into speech.

translate_voice(): Converts speech to text and then translates the recognized text.

swapLanguages(): Swaps the selected source and target languages.
