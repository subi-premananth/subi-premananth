Bank ATM System

Project Description
This is a simple ATM simulation program created with Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows users to interact with their bank accounts, perform operations like deposits, withdrawals, checking balance, and viewing mini statements.

The ATM system supports user authentication with account name and PIN, and displays transaction history.

Features
- User authentication by account name and PIN.
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality.
- Display current account balance.
- View mini statement showing a transaction history.
- Predefined test accounts for initial use.

Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
	bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atm-system.git

2.Navigate to the project directory:

cd atm-system

3.Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from here.

4.Install the Tkinter library if it's not installed. On most systems, Tkinter is included with Python. If it's not, you can install it via the following:

	pip install tk

5.Run the program:

python Bank_ATM_exe.py
